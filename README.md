##CAPS LOCK PIZZA PARLOUR!
by Heather Anderson

A simple js app that lets a user enter in a pizza type and size to find out the number of pieces it will be cut into. Nothing fancy, nothing random. I promise. Would I lie to you?

##Setup

In your browser, run:

`pizza.html`

Enjoy!

##Tests
Testing the js methods can be done via spec-runner.html.

##Known Bugs as of 2/20/15
Not exactly a bug, but I would like the bottom part to be hidden until you click it. Silly css.

##Motivation

To practice writing JS apps and specs.

Note to self: IT'S FRIDAY! YOU MADE AN APP! IT WORKS! Remember to eat a food tonight, because your brain is a bit fuzzy and you feel a bit ill. Food is required for coding, especially when coding with the word pizza for 8 hours.
